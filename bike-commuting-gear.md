# Bike Communting Gear

## Essentials

- A bike
  Obviously you need a bike. But it doesn't have to be fancy, just reliable.
- Helmet
  Please use a helmet. Argue all you want about other countries, but here, we are safer when we have helmets.
- Lock
  If you still want to have a bike at the end of the day. I use a U lock and cable. The U lock locks the rear wheel to a rack, while the cable is looped around to make it hard to steal my front wheel.

## Almost essentials

- Rack
  I love the [Axiom Streamline Disc DLX](http://www.axiomgear.com/products/racks/streamliner-racks/streamliner-disc-dlx/). Fits most bikes easily, sits back a tiny bit so you don't kick your bag.
- Lights
  [Light in Motion Urban](http://www.lightandmotion.com/choose-your-light/urban) is a great line of front lights. Any rear light is fine.
- Fenders
- Bag
- Tubes and knowledge
